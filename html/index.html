                    <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Project Proposal</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">As the COVID-19 stretched into end of 2020, people in Philadelphia began to
                        flock to outdoor green spaces in and around the city. A report from the <a
                            href="https://www.tpl.org/city/philadelphia-pennsylvania"> Trust for Public
                            Land</a> finds that although green spaces in
                        Philadelphia is accessible to most citizens, the amont of green spaces varies greatly based on
                        income and race. </p>
                    <p>And according to
                        <a
                            href="https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-heat-island-climate-change-hunting-park-20190724.html">Inquirer</a>,
                        some Philly neighborhoods can be up to 20°F (6.7°C) hotter than others during the summer months
                        due to Urban Heat Island Effect. The drainage problem of the flood has also become a worrying
                        problem in Philadelphia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, Philadelphia Parks and Recreation budget was cut by 20%
                        during the last fiscal year, equating to about $12.5 million, which means that the budget on
                        new green spaces is limited.!

                        <s>Race</s>
                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The equity of Philadelphia's green space is an issue worth exploring. We built
                        a two-dimensional choropleth map to show the relationship between the park area of different
                        census tracts and their race condition, where the park area is the total area of the park that
                        can be reached within 500 meters of the census tracts. The upper right corner of the legend is
                        the smallest park area and percentage of white and the bottom left is the opposite. So the dark
                        areas in the map are where we need to focus. Philadelphia's next park may be born in these
                        locations. The scatter plot of park area vs. race shows a roughly upward linear relationship,
                        indicating that there is indeed a fairness problem in the distribution of parks in Philadelphia.

                        chart is not as obvious as the previous one, it can also be seen that there is a certain
                        relationship between income and park area.</p>
