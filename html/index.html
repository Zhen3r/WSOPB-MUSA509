                    <h5 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Project Proposal</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">As the COVID-19 stretched into end of 2020, people in Philadelphia began to
                        flock to outdoor green spaces in and around the city. A report from the <a
                            href="https://www.tpl.org/city/philadelphia-pennsylvania"> Trust for Public
                            Land</a> finds that although green spaces in
                        Philadelphia is accessible to most citizens, the amont of green spaces varies greatly based on
                        income and race. </p>
                    <p>And according to
                        <a
                            href="https://www.inquirer.com/science/climate/philadelphia-heat-island-climate-change-hunting-park-20190724.html">Inquirer</a>,
                        some Philly neighborhoods can be up to 20°F (6.7°C) hotter than others during the summer months
                        due to Urban Heat Island Effect. The drainage problem of the flood has also become a worrying
                        problem in Philadelphia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, Philadelphia Parks and Recreation budget was cut by 20%
                        during the last fiscal year, equating to about $12.5 million, which means that the budget on
                        new green spaces is limited.!

                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The equity of Philadelphia's green space is an issue worth exploring. We built
                        a two-dimensional choropleth map to show the relationship between the park area of different
                        census tracts and their race condition, where the park area is the total area of the park that
                        can be reached within 500 meters of the census tracts. The upper right corner of the legend is
                        the smallest park area and percentage of white and the bottom left is the opposite. So the dark
                        areas in the map are where we need to focus. Philadelphia's next park may be born in these
                        locations. The scatter plot of park area vs. race shows a roughly upward linear relationship,
                        indicating that there is indeed a fairness problem in the distribution of parks in Philadelphia.

                        part as in the previous picture is what we need to focus on. Although the pattern of the scatter
                        chart is not as obvious as the previous one, it can also be seen that there is a certain

                        The red area in the picture is where the temperature in Philadelphia is high, which is where the
                        urban heat island effect is significant. Increasing the construction of parks in these areas can
                        effectively alleviate the temperature imbalance.</p>

                        Storm-resistant green spaces can help cities defend themselves against flooding. The purple area
                        on the right is the once-in-100-year flood plain, and the blue area is the once-in-500-year
                        flood plain. These areas are where parks are needed to prevent flooding and reduce the damage of
                        it.</p>

                        new park on a certain location in Philly, <b>a map of cost by census tracts was calculated based
                            on land use, land value and building volume. </b>In terms of land use, we set the index of
                        cost of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Civic/Institution, Transportation areas as 1, Water
                        area as 0.75, Culture/Recreation area as 0.5 and Park/Open Space and Vacant or other usage as
                        0.25, because the renovation cost of built environment is undoubtedly huge, while vacant lots
                        will be less expensive. For the cost of land value and demolition, we directly divide the
                        corresponding value and building volumes into five quantiles. And the total cost is the average
                        of three costs mentioned above. As in shown in the map, the cost of the city center is the
                        largest, which is in line with our expectations.

                        weight of each coefficient is one and the result is shown in the figure on the right. The yellow
                        area represents high feasibility, indicating that these places have the problems above and are
                        more suitable for a new park, while the purple part is the represents low feasibility, meaning
                        that it's not efficient to build a park. You are welcomed to adjust the value of the coefficient
                        by dragging the bar to customize your own formula and see what you've got. The default results
                        show that North Philadelphia needs more new parks and is more suitable for new parks
